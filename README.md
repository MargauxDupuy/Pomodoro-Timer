# PomodoroTimer
The aim of this interface is to help you focus on any task you are working on, such as study, writing, or coding. This app is inspired by Pomodoro Technique which is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo.

## Setup
To launch the interface, run `python PomodoroTimer.py in your terminal.

You can choose the length of sessions and breaks. The classic Pomodoro session is : **Focus on your task for 25 minutes, then take 5 minutes break.**
